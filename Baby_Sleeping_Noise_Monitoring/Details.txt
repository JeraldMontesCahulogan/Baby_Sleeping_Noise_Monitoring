🍼 Baby Sleeping Monitoring System

The Baby Sleeping Monitoring System is an IoT-based project designed to help parents monitor the environment of their baby in real-time. Using a MAX9814 microphone amplifier module, the system continuously listens to the noise level in the baby’s room and sends alerts when loud sounds occur.

This project provides a real-time noise dashboard, WhatsApp notifications, and a history log of all noise incidents that pass the defined threshold.



🔊 Features:

📡 Real-Time Noise Monitoring
• The MAX9814 module (a high-quality microphone amplifier with automatic gain control) captures sound levels inside the baby’s room.
• Noise data is updated live on the system dashboard.

📈 Live Noise Visualization
• Displays the current noise level in real time.
• Helps parents understand patterns and changes in the room environment.

📨 WhatsApp Alerts
• If the noise level exceeds a specific threshold, the system automatically sends a WhatsApp message alert.
• Ensures parents are notified instantly—even if they are away.

📋 Noise History Table
• Logs all noise exceedances.
• Displays timestamp, detected noise level, and other relevant details.
• Helps analyze frequent disturbances or trends.

🧩 Hardware Used
• MAX9814 – A microphone amplifier with automatic gain control (AGC), used for capturing sound levels.
• Microcontroller (ESP32/Arduino/)

🛠️ Software Stack
• Frontend/Backend: PHP
• Database: MYSQL
• WhatsApp API


🎯 Purpose:
This project aims to provide parents with a simple, real-time safety monitoring tool to ensure that their baby’s sleeping environment is quiet and comfortable. By combining IoT hardware and smart notifications, the system improves awareness and peace of mind.
